				<p><li>Since Ahmad is a puppeteer,</li></p>
				<p>Then words must be played like piano strings.</p>
				<p><li>Since knowledge is considered very meer,</li></p>
				<p>Then the society must be in confusion.</p>
				<p><li>Since there is a high percentage of mutineer,</li></p>
				<p>Then atrocities must have to be usual routines.</p>
				<p><li>Since the followers are domineers,</li></p>
				<p>Then the leaders must be apathetic and having no bias.</p>
				<p><li>Since the soldiers are substandard Musketeers,</li></p>
				<p>Then can peace spread its wings?</p>
				<p><li>Since the police are bad pistoleers,</li></p>
				<p>Then thugs shouldn't be out-flings.</p>
				<p><li>Since lawyers always aprive budgeteers,</li></p>
				<p>Then economic stability must always be encountered.</p>
